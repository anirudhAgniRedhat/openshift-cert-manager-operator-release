## Getting started

Use below command to clone the project since it has submodules configured. By default, when we clone a project with
submodules configured, the directories of the submodules are created but will not be initialized with content. With
below command, it will automatically initialize and update each submodule in the repository, including nested submodules
if any of the submodules in the repository have submodules themselves.

```console
git clone --recurse-submodules `fork_repository_web_url`
```

outside the main code repository for better management.
